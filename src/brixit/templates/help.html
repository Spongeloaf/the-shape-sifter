Part dimensions may be entered as digits separated by 'x', '*', or 'by'. The order of the values does not matter either, <b>"2x4"</b> is equivalent to <b>"4x2"</b>. Some parts have three dimensions, simply write the m out like "3x2x5". Whitespace is optional for dimensions; "2 x 4"  and "2x4" are both acceptable.

For example, <b>"2 x 4"</b> would be equivalent to <b>"4by2"</b> or <b>"2* 4"</b>, and <b>"2 x 4 x 8"</b> would be equivalent to <b>"8by2 x 4"</b> or <b>"4 * 8
    by2"</b>.
